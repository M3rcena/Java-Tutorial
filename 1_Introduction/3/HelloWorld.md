### Writing and Running Your First Java Program: Hello, World!
The tradition of creating a "Hello, World!" program is a rite of passage for new programmers in almost every language. It΄s a simple program that serves to introduce you to the basic syntax and structure of the language. Here΄s how to write and run your first Java program:

#### 1. Create a new file:
Open a text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Create a new file named `HelloWorld.java`.

#### 2. Write the program:
Paste the following code into your file:
```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
Let΄s break down the code:
- `public class HelloWorld`: This declares a public class named `HelloWorld`. In Java, programs are organized into classes, which act as blueprints for creating objects.

- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of your program execution. It΄s marked as `public` (accessible from anywhere), `static` (doesn΄t require an object to be created), and returns `void` (doesn΄t return any value). The `String[] args` parameter allows you to pass command-line arguments to your program (optional in this case).
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: This line uses the `System.out` object to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console. `println` adds a newline character after printing the message.

#### 3. Save the file:
Save the file as `HelloWorld.java` in a directory of your choice.

#### 4. Compile the program:
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Use the following command to compile your program:

```javac HelloWorld.java```

The `javac` command is the Java compiler that translates your human-readable code into bytecode, a format that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand. If the compilation is successful, you should see a new file named HelloWorld.class in your directory.

#### 5. Run the program:
Run the compiled program using the following command:

```java HelloWorld```

The `java` command invokes the JVM, which loads and executes the bytecode from the `HelloWorld.class` file. You should see the message "Hello, World!" printed on your console.

Congratulations! You΄ve successfully written and run your first Java program. This is just the beginning of your journey into the world of Java programming. As you learn more, you΄ll be able to create more complex programs that solve real-world problems.
